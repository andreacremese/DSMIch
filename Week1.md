#  Opening remarks

**SciPy stack** has inside pandas and lots of other aspects.

# What is Data Science
Artifical Intelligence in tech firms BUT ALSO smaller firms in order  to make better  decisions.

Hacking skills *Intersect* math and stats *Intersects* substantial experize

**Extract information from data**

1. Exploration and preparation (sanity check, what  fields area available, clean up  where data is dirty)
1. Representation and transformation (restructuring the data with databases  and data streams  AND matematical representations  E.g. Fourier)
1. compute with data (knowledge of the languages,  but also  of the cloud tools and of the libraries that are available)
1. data visulization and presentation
1. data modeling - predictive modeling (infer a model on how the  system works to generate the data AND/OR predict how new  data  will be  generated)
1. science about data science (meta - what works and what doesn't work)


Superset of machine learning and statistics, adding the technology to scale up  to big data. But the idea  is not to scale up, but rather to use the scientific   metodology across all fields. The idea is to **learn  from data**, in an evidence base manner.

It  is also demonstrated that more complicated ML methods are not necessarily better at classifying and generate models. In some cases simpler (and faster  /  less  error prone) methods are as precise in classifications.
